# Common Language Runtime (Functions)

**Common Language Runtime (CLR)** manages the execution of .NET programs. 
The just-in-time compiler converts the compiled code into machine instructions. 
This is what the computer executes. 
The services provided by CLR include memory management, exception handling, type safety, etc.
